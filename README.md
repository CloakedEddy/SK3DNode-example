SK3DNode-example
================

This sample project displays usage of the SK3DNode provided by the Sprite Kit framework in iOS since iOS 8. Since I could not find any working sample code online, I decided to create a brief example which should point people in the right direction.

Please feel free to improve my code where you feel it would better serve the educational purpose.


__Disclaimer__
I have worked off the SceneKit template project provided by Xcode.
